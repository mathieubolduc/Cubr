"white" cross
for each (edge position on the white face)
find edge piece that fills that position
change orientation, looking at nonwhite face
move that piece into that position
if not on it's own color's face and not on the bottom face
if it's in the top position
rotate until it's on the bottom or its color's face
if it's not in the top position
change orientation to look at the opposite face 
use premade sequence X (left or right)
revert orientation
then, if piece is on bottom face
rotate until its on it's color's face
then, if piece is on that face
rotate until correct
if piece is oriented incorrectly
fix it (premade sequence stage 1)
 
"white" corners
for each (corner position on the white face)
orient to look at the left of the two nonwhite faces on that corner
find corner piece that fills that position
move that piece into that position
if on the white face, but not the right corner
orient to look at one of the faces that the piece is on
use sequence X (left or right)
revert orientation
then, if on bottom face
rotate bottom until that piece is on left bottom corner of face we're looking at
change orient to look at other nonwhite face of desired piece
use X (left)
until piece is oriented correctly
use X (left)
rotate bottom counterclock
repeat
 
middle band
for each (position in the middle row)
find piece that fits that position
change orientation to look at left of the two faces for that position
set up the piece
if piece if in the middle row (in wrong spot or wrong orientation)
change orientation to look at on of the faces that piece is on (if needed)
use premade sequence to move a different piece into the spot the desired piece is in
(this will force the desired piece out onto the yellow face
then, if piece is on yellow face
rotate yellow face until color of side face of edge piece matches center square of face
use premade sequence codename pickles
 
yellow face
change orientation to look at yellow face
repeat until complete yellow face
if two adjacent corners have yellow facing us
rotate orientation so that the two adjacent corners are on "top"
if one corner has yellow facing us (or two nonadjacent corners)
rotate orientation so that yellow corner is on "bottom left" of yellow face
if no corners have yellow facing us
rotate orientation so that yellow is on left face
apply sequence pineapple
 
fixing the last bits
first part
rotate top until at least 2 corners match their faces
if the only two correct corners are nonadjacent
use sequence potato
(this will force two adjacent correct corners)
orient so that two adjacent correct corners are in back
use sequence potato
second part
(now all corners should be correct, need to fix yellow edge pieces)
SUBOPTIMAL
repeat sequence celery clockwise until solved
more optimal
if all four edges are wrong
apply sequence celery (either direction)
if 3 edges are wrong
orient so that the correct side is on the back
determine whether the remaining sides need to cycle clockwise or counterclockwise
apply sequence celery in the correct direction
 
premade sequences
X (left or right)
if left
move front counterclock
move bottom clock
move front clock
if right
move front clock
move bottom clock
move front counterclock
